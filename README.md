# Welcome to the HyperText Party!
HyperText Party is a collection of animated css and javascript text effects developed as Vue.js components and formatted as a playable demonstration site. Able to be used in different ways, some can run continuously and some are intended to wait until a triggering event like a page scroll or click, some require Javascript, and some are CSS only.
